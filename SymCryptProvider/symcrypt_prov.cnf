# The SymCrypt provider needs to be registered with libcrypto,
# either by config or with OSSL_PROVIDER_load. The provider can
# be disabled by commenting out or removing "activate = 1". The
# value assigned does not matter, and the provider will be
# activated as long as the "activate" key is present.
