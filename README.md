# SCOSSL - The SymCrypt engine for OpenSSL

The SymCrypt engine for OpenSSL (SCOSSL) allows the use of OpenSSL with [SymCrypt](https://github.com/Microsoft/SymCrypt) as the provider
for core cryptographic operations. It leverages the [OpenSSL engine interface](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/engine.html) to
override the cryptographic implementations in OpenSSL's libcrypto.so with SymCrypt's implementations. The primary motivation for this is to
support FIPS certification, as vanilla OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have a FIPS-certified cryptographic module.

Where possible the SCOSSL will direct OpenSSL API calls to the SymCrypt FIPS module. In cases where SymCrypt cannot (currently) support an
OpenSSL API, the best effort is made to fall-back to the default OpenSSL implementation of the given function. In a few cases the engine
will instead fail the call completely, as re-routing to OpenSSL's implementation is not always easy, and as with any project we have to
prioritize!

**Important note:** The code in this repository is currently undergoing validation for use in Microsoft-internal products. At this time, it
has not been tested for use in other environments and should not be considered production-ready.

## Algorithms that will be routed to a FIPS certifiable SymCrypt module with this version

The following list is not necessarily exhaustive, and will be updated as more functionality is added to SCOSSL.
Note that just because an algorithm is FIPS certifiable, does not mean it is recommended for use. SSH-KDF implementation is disabled by default and can be enabled by adding `-DSCOSSL_SSHKDF=1` argument to CMake. This algorithm also requires OpenSSL source code in the build process.

 + Key derivation

## Known cases where SCOSSL will fail rather than fallback to default OpenSSL

1. Use of unsupported digests in RSA signatures, TLS PRF, and HMAC
2. Use of multi-prime (more than 2-prime) RSA

## Versioning and Servicing

As of version 1.0.0, SCOSSL uses the versioning scheme defined by the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) specification. This means:

- Major version changes introduce ABI and/or API breaking changes
- Minor version changes introduce backwards compatible additional functionality or improvements, and/or bug fixes
- Patch version changes introduce backwards compatible bug fixes

Regarding servicing, our strong recommendation is that distro vendors and application developers regularly
update to the latest version of SymCrypt and SymCrypt engine for both security fixes and
functionality/performance improvements.

We will support long-term servicing of specific releases for security fixes. Details of this plan will be
released publicly in the future.

# Building Instructions
## Compilation Instructions

1. Install libssl, or compile and install OpenSSL from source
2. Follow Linux build instructions from SymCrypt repository [SymCrypt](https://github.com/Microsoft/SymCrypt) to build the Linux SymCrypt module
    * You can either install the Linux SymCrypt module (i.e libsymcrypt.so* to /usr/lib/, and inc/* to /usr/include/), or
    * Copy the built module to the root of the SymCrypt-OpenSSL repo `cp <SymCryptRepo>/bin/module/<arch>/LinuxUserMode/<module_name>/libsymcrypt.so ./`
3. `mkdir bin; cd bin`
4. `cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake-toolchain/LinuxUserMode-<arch>.cmake`
    * If you have not installed SymCrypt header files, you can also specify the root directory `-DSYMCRYPT_ROOT_DIR=<SymCryptRepo>`
    * If you want to link to a specific OpenSSL installation, you can also specify `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<OpensslInstallDirectory>`
    * Optionally, for a release build, specify `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
5. `cmake --build .`
    * Optionally specify `-jN` where N is the number of processes you wish to spawn for the build

## Run Samples
```
./SslPlay/SslPlay
